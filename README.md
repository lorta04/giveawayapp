# Backend run (On your local side)
backend command run : `nodemon server` or `node server`

## Update on 12 Nov 2019
Our website is deployed on https://giveawayapp1.herokuapp.com/
but we haven't deployed back-end side yet...
To run my full version application , You must clone my project git then run back-end side on your localhost 
On your local project folder, ` cd ./backend ` then follow the step of backend-run command...
